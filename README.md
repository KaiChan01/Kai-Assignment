# Kai-Assignment
My assignment for programming.

I plan to use the dataset gathered from a boxing match between Manny Pacquiao and Juan Manuel MÃ¡rquez.
I will present the dataset by using pie charts(Percentage of punches laned) and bar charts(Punches thrown per round),
the program should allow users to view and compare the data of both fighters. 

I plan to look into animation and possibly 3d visualisation for the advanced features.


2nd and final Deliverable

For my core features I was successful in impletementing the barchart and a Donut/Pie (idea from League of Legends) chart. 
Firstly the user can interacts with the program by pressing keys to choose what visualisation to display. Secondly the user 
can interact with the barchart and piechart by using the mouse and hovering over certain elements for extra information. 

For the advance features I tried adding classes in my program, at the time I wasn't too familiar in using classes

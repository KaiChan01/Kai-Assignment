# Kai-Assignment
My assignment for programming.

I plan to use the dataset gathered from a boxing match between Manny Pacquiao and Juan Manuel Márquez.
I will present the dataset by using pie charts(Percentage of punches laned) and bar charts(Punches thrown per round),
the program should allow users to view and compare the data of both fighters. 

I plan to look into animation and possibly 3d visualisation for the advanced features.
